## Background and Purpose
Raising the flag and singing the national anthem is a meaningful ritual and a cherished cultural tradition observed in institutions, organizations, schools, and the armed forces. It embodies a profound love for the homeland, a deep sense of pride, and national dignity. This practice serves as a reminder for all to remain committed to personal growth, to strive to fulfill their duties, and to uphold traditional cultural values and professionalism in the workplace.

However, as international students, we cannot maintain this routine while studying abroad, which inspired me to create this project. By coding the Vietnamese national anthem, I hope to bring a piece of this tradition to life digitally, allowing us to reconnect with our culture and remember the values it instills, even when we are far from home.
