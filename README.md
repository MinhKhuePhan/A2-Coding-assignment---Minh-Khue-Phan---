# Assignment 2: Code Prototype Project 
# Recreating Vietnam's National Anthem in TunePad
> This project, titled "Recreating Vietnam's National Anthem in TunePad," uses musical coding to bring to life the Vietnamese national anthem, Tiến Quân Ca, on TunePad, a Python-based music composition platform. The goal is to evoke a sense of cultural pride and nostalgia, especially for Vietnamese students in Australia who may feel distant from their homeland. By coding this anthem, the project seeks to strengthen cultural connections through music, blending technical precision with emotional impact. This repository includes the code, documentation, and insights into the creative process behind recreating a beloved national song.

## General Information
This project, "Recreating Vietnam's National Anthem in TunePad," is a musical coding initiative designed to bring the Vietnamese national anthem, Tiến Quân Ca, to life using Python. The project aims to help Vietnamese students in Australia reconnect with their homeland by evoking a sense of cultural pride and nostalgia through music.

Problem it solves: For many Vietnamese students living abroad, maintaining a strong connection to their culture can be challenging. This project addresses the sense of disconnection by recreating a familiar, emotionally resonant song that has been a part of our lives since childhood.

Purpose: The primary purpose of this project is to bridge the emotional distance felt by Vietnamese students in Australia, creating a piece that allows them to remember and celebrate their roots, even when far from home.

Why I undertook it: As someone who values the power of music to evoke memory and connection, I wanted to use coding as a medium to foster this sense of identity. At first, I didn’t realize that music could be created through coding, but after working on this project, I now know it’s possible. This experience allowed me to explore creative coding in a way that strengthened my connection to my homeland.
